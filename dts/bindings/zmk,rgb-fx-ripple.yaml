properties:
  duration:
    type: int
    default: 1000
    description: |
      Approximate ripple travel time in milliseconds.

  color:
    type: int

  buffer-size:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      This will limit how many keystroke events the effect is able to track
      at the same time. Depending on how fast you type and the effect duration
      you might need to increase this number.

  ripple-width:
    type: int
    default: 25
    description: |
      This setting determines the thickness of the ripple 'ring'.
      Think of it as antialiasing. The further apart the pixels are, or if they're
      spaced irregularly, the larger this number should be. Otherwise the effect
      will look uneven or LEDs might not light up at all.
      This effect is especially pronounced when lowering the effect duration or running
      low FPS.
