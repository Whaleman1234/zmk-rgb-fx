  Animates a linear gradient alternating between the given colors.

compatible: "zmk,rgb-fx-linear-gradient"

include: rgb-fx-base.yaml

properties:
  colors:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Gradient colors

  angle:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Gradient angle expressed in degrees. 0 degrees gives a horizontal gradient from left to right.

  gradient-width:
    type: int
    default: 255
    description: |
      The total width of the entire gradient (all colors!).
      This is relative to the pixel-coordinate system.

  duration:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Time it takes for the gradient to animate back to its original position.
      Set to 0 for a static gradient.

  use-rgb-interpolation:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Gradients use HSL interpolation by default. Set this setting to true to use RGB instead.
